# Question
What does it mean when a tag is a "child" of a "parent?".

# Answer
The terms `child` and `parent` describes the hierarchical relationship between the elements in HTML. 

A `parent` element contains one or more other elements (child elements) nested within it. For example, `<div>` or `<section>` elements can act as parent elements because they can contain other elements inside them. 

A `child` element is nested within another element (parent element). For example, the parent element `<div>` can hold the child elements of `<p>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, etc. 

```html
 <div> <!--parent element -->
    <p>Child Element</p> <!-- child element -->
    <img src="" alt="">  <!-- also child element -->
</div>
```
