# Question
Where do html attributes go?

# Answer
HTML attributes are placed within the opening tag of an HTML element. They provide additional information about the element or specify how the element should behave or appear. 

Attributes can also be used for styling (`class`, `style`), specifying relationships (`id`), providing alternative text (`alt`), and more.

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com/">Link to Google</a>>
```

In the code snippet, `href` is an attribute tag within the anchor tag that specifies the URL to which the link leads.
