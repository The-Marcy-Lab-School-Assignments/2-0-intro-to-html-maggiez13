# Question
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer
Semantic tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. For example, tags like `<header>`, `<button>`, and `<figure>` are considered to be semantic tags as they clearly indicate the role of the content they contain. 

Non-semantic tags do not inherently convey any meaning about the content they contain. They are often used to group content for styling purposes or to create layout structures. Some examples of non-semantic tags are `<div>`, `<span>`, and `<b>`.
